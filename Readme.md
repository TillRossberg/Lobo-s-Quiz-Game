# Lobo-s-Quiz-Game
A game to help grade schoolers improve their skills on office applications.

Just download and start the application. AJ1 is for the first graders and AJ2 for the second graders. Enjoy!

During my studies I started working as a teacher for grade schoolers. 
The company I worked for teaches children the use of office applications in a playful way.
This game was intended to test and improve their skill on the lessons subjects.
It also was my first paid programming job. :)
